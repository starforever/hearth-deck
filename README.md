HearthDeck
========

I have been playing [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) for a while and found the game quite fascinating and full of challenges.
There are hundreds of different cards available for selecting to forge a deck and play against other players around the world.
As one of the key strategic elements of the game, card construction plays an important role in the outcome of a match.
Forging a suitable deck for your hero could increase your chance of winning the game.

A lot of players have shared their decks on websites such as [HearthPwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com/) for others to refer to.
However, since all expert cards are not initially available, you may not have all the needed cards in your collection to forge a deck made by someone else.
Therefore I create HearthDeck to help players (including myself) to select the best possible decks that are currently possible to forge.

Given the information of your card collection and the hero you want to play, HearthDeck will nicely show you the best rated decks you can currently forge.
Either you already have all needed cards in your collection, or you have enough Arcane Dust to obtain the missing cards through crafting.

The decks suggested by HearthDeck are collected from HearthPwn by parsing its web pages.
In the future I may consider adding support to collect decks from more websites.

I hope HearthDeck can save you time to find a good deck to play and enrich your gaming experience.
Good luck and have fun!
